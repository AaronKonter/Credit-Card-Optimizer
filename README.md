# Credit-Card-Optimizer
Python program that optimizes my credit card usage for award points



**Why**

I have 4 credit cards that all give me multiplied rewards points in various spending categories and it's hard to keep them all straight. I want to take my wife to Europe, and I want to do it right. The more award points I have, the more baller the trip.

**How**

The program will offer available award categories. 

Ask the user to choose one. 

Tell the user which card to use as well as other options.
